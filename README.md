# Diploma Final Project
## AI-Powered Analysis in Smart Home Environment

This project is developed as part of my diploma thesis at the **University Politehnica of Bucharest**, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers.  
It explores the use of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **IoT sensor data** for understanding and optimising human behaviour in a smart home environment.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a modular system capable of:
1. **Recognising human activities (HAR)** plan to use Wi-Fi CSI (Channel State Information) signals through deep learning models (e.g. Bi-LSTM);
2. **Analysing behavioural patterns** to distinguish between *automated*, *optimising*, and *negative* behaviours;
3. **Triggering or recommending smart home actions** (e.g. turn lights on, restrict screen use, optimise sleep routines) based on learned patterns.




The work combines principles from:
- **Ambient Assisted Living (AAL)** – AI & IoT for improving quality of life;
- **Human Activity Recognition (HAR)** – detecting daily activities from sensor data;
- **Smart Home Automation (SHA)** – enabling adaptive and predictive control.
